# Package Delivery Application
- This is a project specified by WGU to solve a package delivery routing problem, which is essentially the traveling salesman problem with a dedicated starting node and a few restrictions/requirements. For my solution, I implemented the nearest neighbor algorithm which operates with a time-complexity of O(n).
